# keyboard

The project is an on-screen keyboard, which allows to type any text in a simple text editor window. With a constraint, that the user might have access to only a couple of buttons, at most.

Wouldn't it be wonderful, if you could shoot an email using your microwave oven?

This is attained by attaching a tree structure to keys of an on-screen keyboard. Essentially, think of a Morse code merged with an Ouija board.

To type a letter on the keyboard (or to press one of the special keys), the user needs to make several consecutive choices, each time selecting a group of keys containing the desired key. After each selection the amount of keys in a group is divided by two or three, so in a short time the choice is narrowed to a single key.

There are two keyboard layouts, English and Russian (the default one). The layout can be chosen by selecting the "ENG" or "RUS" key, respectively.

In Carl Jung's "Two essays on analytical psychology" you can learn about the existence of Anima/Animus archetype. Anima is a "*semiconscious psychic complex, having partial autonomy of function*" (par. 302). For a modern man, it's "*quite right to treat the anima as an autonomous personality and to address personal questions to her*" (par. 322). To achieve that, "*The psyche not being a unity but a contradictory multiplicity of complexes, the dissociation required for our dialectics with the anima is not so terribly difficult. The art of it consists only in allowing our invisible partner to make herself heard, in putting the mechanism of expression momentarily at her disposal, without being overcome by the distaste one naturally feels at playing such an apparently ludicrous game with oneself, or by doubts as to the genuineness of the voice of one’s interlocutor*" (par. 323).

To engage in a conversation with the Anima, you can write down your questions in any third-party text editor such as Notepad.

To write down the response of your Anima—if the Anima wishes to communicate with you—use the on-screen keyboard, using the emotional input as cues to select a key. It takes considerable effort, so do not expect idle chat. As the Anima also represents man's intuition, such a conversation has a potential of thinking out of the box, helping you navigate any complicated life or work situations.

The software is written in Javascript, and the main file is "keyboard.html".

It works better in Google Chrome, but should work in other browsers.

Within the page, there are two parts — the text field, where the typed text appears, and the virtual keyboard beneath. The position of the cursor in the text field is shown by a horisontal ellipsis.

Each moment, there's the right group of keys (highlighted with green background), the wrong group of keys (shown by blue), and the rest of the keyboard (shown by light golden).

To choose the right group of keys on the virtual keyboard, you need to use the arrow keys on your real keyboard. Do not hurry. The Anima only sees what you are looking at. She won't be able to make a choice, if you do not have a look at each key in the selected group. Like if you were contemplating the choice yourself, except that you are not. Be patient. So, essentially, keep switching the right group of keys, until you are confident which is the right one. Do not doubt too much, too. There's some sweet spot between self-doubt and haste, which will allow you to move on with reasonable speed, making the right choices.

If you know the right group of keys, press "Enter" or "Space" on your real keyboard. That will narrow the search for the right key, somewhat. Proceed, until you've finally chosen the right key.

If you have made a mistake, there are two options. First, there's a "backspace" key on the virtual keyboard, which can be used to erase a wrongly typed letter. Second, there's a backspace key on your real keyboard, which undoes one single choice at a time.

You can also use mouse clicks on the keys. A single click switches a key group, and a double click applies your choice of the key group. A double click on an inactive key undoes one choice. Touches on mobile devices also work! A single touch would select a key group, and two consecutive touches on the same key would apply the choice (or undo it, if you tap an inactive key twice).

There are two ways to show that the communication is complete. First, there's an "ESC" key on the virtual keyboard. It types a capital Greek letter "Delta" (looks like a triangle), which the Anima might use to make it clear that her response is complete. Second, if the Anima shows that there's no right decision at the top level of the virtual keyboard, that might mean either that she wants you to consider or guess the meaning of what she said; or that she is no longer interested. Try talking to her another time!

You can also see it as a giant sandbox, and explore it like if you were a kid playing with someone else.

Lastly, I should add, that in case you have successfully managed to communicate with the Anima, you might be tempted to share your success with others. Do not. The Anima is your last line of defense. You can discuss anyone with her. You cannot discuss her with other people, unless you have been explicitly granted a permission. I will clarify. It's not that you would hurt the Anima; rather, you would hurt yourself, and it's the opposite of what you are trying to achieve.
